    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the project is to provide the most up to date information about road incidents. This information becomes especially critical in emergency situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter and Google maps are a power couple capable of delivering what we need. Whereas, Twitter has indisputably become a source of most up to date information, Google maps have the most comprehensive coverage of all roads worldwide. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API's of both have been used and were part of the built of our solution, along with other specialized social media sources, including Mass511 and navbug. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution leverages on these sources of information to identify a link between the closed road mentioned in the Tweet, for example, and the proposed (alternative) route suggested by Google maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that first respondents are called for an evacuation mission, as they check for the fastest/safest route toward their destination, the road flagged by Twitter will be signaled in the Google map search, as a non usable route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focused on the city of Medford, MA.\n",
    "\n",
    "This readme section is focused on how twitter and google api's were used to build our solution. Steps to get the information from twitter and google are described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The outline below covers the scope of the steps taken:**\n",
    "  - Data collection\n",
    "  - Data cleaning\n",
    "  - Model testing\n",
    "  - Further improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Google maps, with a simple API query, provides information about the distance, travel time and alternative  routes between any origin and destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google directions API allowed us to programmatically collect the specific information we were looking for: \n",
    "  - distance between two given locations or coordinates\n",
    "  - time of travel, given the mode of travel\n",
    "  - distance and duration of travel, given time of day, factoring in traffic\n",
    "  - directions, with the coordinates of every leg of the journey\n",
    "  - importance of nodes (road intersections) based on the frequency of their use\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the API is not free, Google provides a $300 credit. About $100 were used for 10,000 requests. a Key is required to conduct those queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Live Tweets \n",
    "\n",
    "The dedicated API for live tweets is [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/3.7.0/getting_started.html). \n",
    "The use of Tweepy API requires registration with Twitter. By registring our project with Twitter, we obtain a token and a secret key, which is needed to create an OAuthHandler instance. This instance is needed to use the geo_search function of the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, the geo_search method allows to zoom in on a particular location (the origin location of the tweets) the API search (.search) method allows to incorporate any keywords with which the tweets are filtered. 'OR' can also be included in the search in order not to restrict results to only one form of expression of 'closed roads'. Other expressions include 'heavy traffic', 'bumper to bumper', 'road diversion', etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "In[]: place_ld:'unique identifier' \"road closed\" OR \"heavy traffic\"\n",
    "Out[]: running late road M 16 closed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Old Tweets\n",
    "Given that live tweets are limited to the past 7 days, and the fact that we limited our focus to a, rather small, city, we needed more data/tweets to supplement our model. For this purpose, we used the **GetOldTweets3 library**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**regular expressions** was used to clean the html formatting of the tweets and extract key words, including road numbers, street names, nature of incident, etc. This method was not successful all the time. More finetuning needs to be done to identify the part of the road that is  actually closed. For example, when a tweet says: MA 99 is closed between MA 16 and MA 28, it was challenging to always determine that the remainder of MA 99 should not be made unusable. this is an example of a perfect outcome: \n",

    "![Road closure tweets](./images/road_closure_tweet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this data gathered along with other social media sources, including Mass511 and nvabug, we were able to make the simulation needed to test our model, as discribed in the simulation readme of the project. The objective is to accurately destroy a radius of roads based on the real-time closure information, and at the same time create/highlight alternative routes, through Google maps, for first respondents to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "This report highlighted the steps undertaken to gather traffic and road closure information from Google and Twitter, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An extension of this part of the project would be to:**\n",
    "- leverage on the capabilities of regular expressions, to more precisely extract information from social media, especially when the information is a mixture of words and numbers and when words can influence the ranking or placement of those numbers.\n",
    "- make the model iterative: when a road cannot be used, other routes will be taken to exit the city or the disaster area which creates heavier traffic in those alternative roads. In this situation, Twitter will keep updating the situation of the roads, and inform first respondents and residents of additional roads to avoid, or roads that have been cleared after the attendance of traffic police\n",
    "- apply the model to a busier city to be able to integrate live tweets and google maps and test the model output on live information\n",
